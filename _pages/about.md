Hi. I'm studying for an [MSc in Advanced Computer Science](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-advanced-computer-science) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/).
My research interests are in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and I am currently working on Multi-Agent RL at the [Whiteson Research Lab (WhiRL)](https://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/) for my MSc thesis supervised by [Mingfei Sun](https://mingfeisun.github.io/) and [Prof. Shimon Whiteson](http://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/pages/people/shimon.html).

I previously interned as an applied scientist at [Quincus](https://www.quincus.com/media_news/yahoo-finance-leader-in-ai-driven-supply-chain-technology-quincus-announces-toronto-rd-expansion/) where I built RL models to optimise middle-mile logistics, and as a software engineer at [Amazon](https://amazon.jobs/en/business_categories/student-programs) where I built an AI-based tool to revise business metrics across Amazon Transportation Services.

I graduated with a [BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/bachelor/bachelor-of-science) from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en) and was a visiting student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), and [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/).

At Oxford, I lead the Careers team of the [Oxford Artificial Intelligence society (OxAI)](https://oxai.org/) and play as a libero for the [men's Blues volleyball team](https://www.sport.ox.ac.uk/volleyball).
